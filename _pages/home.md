Hi! I'm a senior at Columbia University studying Computer Engineering. I'm part of the 3-2 combined plan with [Bard College at Simon's Rock](https://simons-rock.edu/), where I completed my Physics degree.

## Research
I'm interested in [analog](/projects/analog/) and [digital](/articles/vlsi) IC design, [custom accelerators](/projects/circuitsim), and computer architecture.

I'm currently a member of the Mobile X Lab under the guidance of Professor Xia Zhou, where I design circuits for wearable devices

Previously, I contributed to research projects in the labs of:
- Professor Katayun Barmak
- Professor Michael Bergman
- Professor Xi Chen

You can find more about my current and past work in the [research](/publications/) section.

## Teaching
I'm currently a TA for [Embedded Systems](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2026/4840-spring/index.html) (CSEE 4840)

I TAed for Fundies, and here are some [study guides](/teaching/2025-fundies). I was also the ODS notetaker for a variety of CSEE [courses](/courses).

I'm previously a Think Tank drop-in tutor at Simon's Rock, where I helped students across a range of [STEM courses](/teaching/)

## Personal
I love:
- Coding, electronics, and math. 
- Long drives or bus/subway rides, doing nothing
- Mastering difficult material
- Writing and archiving stuff, just like this website.
