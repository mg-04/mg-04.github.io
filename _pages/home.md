Hi! I'm a senior at Columbia University studying Computer Engineering. I'm part of the 3-2 combined plan with [Bard College at Simon's Rock](https://simons-rock.edu/), where I completed my Physics degree.

## Research
I'm currently a member of the Mobile X Lab under the guidance of Professor Xia Zhou, where I design circuits for wearable devices

Previously, I contributed to research projects in the labs of:
- Professor Katayun Barmak
- Professor Michael Bergman
- Professor Xi Chen

You can find more about my current and past work in the [research](/publications/) section.

## Teaching
I'm currently the TA for Fundies (CSEE 3827), hosting office hours and recitations, as well as writing some [study guides](/teaching/2025-fundies)

I'm also the ODS notetaker for a variety of CSEE [courses](/courses).

I'm previously a Think Tank drop-in tutor at Simon's Rock, where I helped students across a range of STEM courses, including
- Ordinary Differential Equations
- Classical Mechanics
- Organic Chemistry I & II
- Intro to Quantum Physics
- Physics II
- Chemistry I & II

## Personal
I love coding, electronics, and math. I also like to write and archive stuff, just like this website.
