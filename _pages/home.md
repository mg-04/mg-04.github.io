## Teaching
I'm currently the TA for Fundies (CSEE 3827). I'm also the ODS notetaker for a variety of CSEE courses.

I'm previously a Think Tank drop-in tutor at Simon's Rock, and I've tutored the following courses

## Personal
I love coding, circuits, and math. I also like to write and archive stuff, just like this website.
