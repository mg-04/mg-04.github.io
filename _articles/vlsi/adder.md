Now comes the first real task of 4321: adder

A few points:
- Use a bit pitch width of 2.1 um!!! You will know why.
- For the purpose of this final project, use ripple carry, since it's only 8-bits. You can show off with a more complex carry structure, but they won't help you much in pre-sim, and *definitely* won' help you in post-sim.
