In this set of articles, I will walk through the essence of the 4321 layout, so you can achieve an A-tier layout as a complete newbie (like me!) It will be a *huge* learning curve, and that's exactly the point. The guide is meant to help you avoid many of the traps and misjudgments we fell early on, so you can focus on what *actually* matters. With that noise filtered out, you can start to appreciate the real beauty of custom layout. Enjoy.

Our project is **FAR from perfect**. In fact, when I was writing this, I constantly realize how much I still don't know about Cadence Virtuoso, and how our layout can be more efficient in this and that way. Nevertheless, the task is to get the project *done*, and done *well*, but not *perfectly*. In the end, this is an older technology, intended for learning and practice, so don’t pull your hair out.

# General Advice
> Find a good teammate

Half of the class were having teammate issues; the other half *are* the teammate issues

> Pull a few all-nighters

Yes. You need stamina

> Ask people around you

They may happen to know a lot more you've never seen before. Read relevant sections of the textbook. Search online for how other people do it

> Focus on exams

They worth more, and generally easier to prepare



> Don't be scared of the learning curve

You will be surprised on how much this can push your limit

> Don't cheat

This guide is never intended to help you cheat. You literally can’t cheat with it (unless I hand you my GDS files!).
