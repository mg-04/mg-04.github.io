Oh damn such a hard project!

After struggling my way through this class, I wanted to write a guide that future students can actually use, so they will not fall into the same trap that I did. Then, you will truly enjoy the beauty of custom layout.

Many layouts don't suck at the end, they suck at the **beginning**! A bad initial decision will make you either **REDO** from scratch, or make **WORSE** and **WORSE** compromises to accomodate that
- **Disclaimer**: I'm not saying our layout is anything good. It is FAR from optimal.
- Most bad layouts will still have complete functionality, just a bad grade, so don't stress out too much about that 

This guide is never intended to cheat. You literally can’t cheat with it (unless I hand you my GDS files!).
