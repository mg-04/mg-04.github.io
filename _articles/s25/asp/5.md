## System calls
### `open()` 
```c
int open(const char *path, int oflag, mode_t mode);
```
- `mode`  for file permission if new file created

```c
/* Example file creation for writing ("w" for fopen())*/
#include <fcntl.h>

int fd;
mode_t mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH; // rw- r-- r--
char *pathname = "/tmp/file";

// write only, create if not exist, replace if exist
fd = open(pathname, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, mode);
```
- `O_EXCL` (exclusive): raise error if `O_CREAT` and file exists

 `creat(path, mode)`: `open(path, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, mode)`
 
 `int close(int fildes)`: Deletes the file descriptor table entry at `fildes`.
 
` off_t lseek(int fildes, off_t offset, int whence);` changes where next IO will take place. 
- File offset stored in the *file table entry* for the **current process**

### Read
```c
ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);
```
Returns 0 on EOF and -1 on error. 
- May block forever on "slow" read from pipes, FIFOs, sockets, or keyboard
- Disk IO is not "slow" read, since it eventually returns
### Write
```c
ssize_t write(int fildes, const void *buf, size_t nbyte);
```
Also **slow** syscall for pipes, FIFOs, or sockets
- When reading side is too busy, **pipe** internal buffer fills up, and `write()` blocks.

**Atomicity**: make sure either **all/none** are performed. Can't only do a subset and fail in the middle
- E. **appending** to file: 
	- 1. `lseek()`; 2. `write()`, not atomic
	- `write(O-APPEND)` is atomic
## C stdio
wrapper on top of UNIX IO
```c
FILE *fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode); // open()
int fclose(FILE *stream);  // close()
int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);  // lseek()
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);  // read()
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);  // write()
```

### Buffering
but maintain an **internal buffer** at application layer. Every operation may not translate to the kernel system call call. Can be buffered.

```shell
strace ./program   # traces syscalls
```

## File sharing

### Kernel file data structure

![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/file-kernel.jpg)

- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Process</span> table entry: array of *file pointers*, indexed by **fd**
	- 0, 1, 2, are pre-opened by OS
	- For two <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">independent</span> processes, they will have independent file table entries, but point to the same i-node
	- `dup(fd)` takes existing open `fd` and **duplicates** its process table entry. Both will point to the same file table entry.
	- `fork()`, all descriptors are copied to the new process, as if `dup()`ed. Parent and child share the same file table entry
- FIle table entry (possibly shared): instance of opened file
- When file opens, kernel prepares a structure **i-node** (v and i are combined to i-node for linux)
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">1-to-1</span> mapping between i-node entry and file
    
### Open fork order
`fork-then-open.c`
```c
if (fork() == 0)
	sleep(1);
fd = open(path);
for (c = 'A'; c < 'A' + 5; c++) {
    write(fd, &c, 1);
    sleep(2);
}
```
Parent and child have their own *file offset*. Parent writes "a", child writes "a" again on the same spot, overwrites it, only one copy written
- To coordinate, you'll need to send a message to the other process, complicated

 `open-then-fork.c`
If open and fork order swapped, parent and child will share the same file table entry (offset), and "aa" will be printed.
