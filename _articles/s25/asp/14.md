## Linker
`seald`

### Minimal ELF
Just generating `Ehdr`, fill out all the files
```shell
./gen-exe
# creates a.out, a binary file with *just* the header (64b)
readelf -a a.out
```

No data section, no linking with standard library

Has a "section to segment mapping"

### Minimal exe
Elf header, program header, .txt, section header, but no strings
Assemble `hello.s` into object
```sh
cpp hello.c hello.i
cc1 hello.i -Og -o hello.s
as -o hello.o hello.s      # assemble hello.s
ld -o hello hello.o 
```
`hello.s`
- Push 4-byte integer "\nPSA" (written backwards) onto the **stack**
- Setup `syscall` registers to `write(1, "ASP\n", 4)`
- `exit(0)`
`_start:` declares a function. `.globl` makes it have a symbol (global function)
```shell
readelf hello
# a few more symbols from real linker
./cld hello.o
# creates a.out
readelf ./a.out
```
Sections will be defined, but `<no-strings>`, since don't have `.shstr` tab
- Put `.text` int offset 0x1000 (dec 4096, a page)
- Each segment must start at a **page** boundary (since `mmap()`ed)
- If not a new segment, can start anywhere. There may still be alignment requirements

### Relocation
Link single object file, compiled from C
`echo.c`
```c
char newline[] = "\n";
// shorthand newline[2] = { '\n', '\0' };
// STACK allocated array

char *newline = "\n";      
// in read-only section, declare a stack-allocated pointer
// can't have, since we don't yet have a .rodata section
```
Need to write `my_libc.h` to handle `write()` as a system call, adapted from the Linux kernel
1. Define constants
    ```c
    #ifndef __MY_LIBC_H__
    #define __MY_LIBC_H__

    /*
    * Header file for minimal C standard library.
    */

    // Standard stream file descriptors
    #define STDIN_FILENO  0
    #define STDOUT_FILENO 1
    #define STDERR_FILENO 2

    // System call numbers for x86_64 Linux
    #define __NR_write 1
    #define __NR_exit 60
    ```

2. `syscall()` is implemented as an **inline assembly** function (mixing assembly inside of C code)
    ```c
    static inline long syscall(long n, long a1, long a2, long a3, long a4, long a5, long a6) {
        long ret;

        // map variables to specific registers
        register long _num  asm("rax") = n;
        register long _arg1 asm("rdi") = a1;
        register long _arg2 asm("rsi") = a2;
        register long _arg3 asm("rdx") = a3;
        register long _arg4 asm("r10") = a4;
        register long _arg5 asm("r8")  = a5;
        register long _arg6 asm("r9")  = a6;

        // map variables to registers, with readonly, writeonly, ...
        asm volatile (
            "syscall\n\t"
            : "=a" (ret)
            : "0" (_num), "r" (_arg1), "r" (_arg2), "r" (_arg3), "r" (_arg4),
            "r" (_arg5), "r" (_arg6)
            : "memory", "cc", "r11", "rcx"
        );

        return ret;
    }
    ```

3. Now write `exit()` and `write()` syscalls
	- Defined as static, only usable in this compilation unit (only C files that `#include` this header)
	- In the ELF files, those symbols will be defined as **local**, won't get linked

    ```c
    static inline __attribute__((noreturn)) void exit(int code) {
        syscall(__NR_exit, code, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
        __builtin_unreachable();    // exit() is not suppose to return
    }

    static inline void write(int fd, const char *buf, unsigned long len) {
        syscall(__NR_write, fd, (long)buf, len, 0, 0, 0);
    }
    ```

4. Loader jumps to `_start` for entry point

    ```c
    /*
    * Sets up the environment for a C program and calls main().
    */
    // global functions
    void _start_c(long *sp) {
        // setup the argv array
        long argc;
        char **argv;
        char **envp;
        int ret;

        // Silence warnings about different types for main()
        int _mylib_main(int, char **, char **) __asm__ ("main");
        //			   (argc, argv, envar)
        /*
        * sp  :  argc          <-- argument count, required by main()
        * argv:  argv[0]       <-- argument vector, required by main()
        *        argv[1]
        *        ...
        *        argv[argc-1]
        *        NULL
        * envp:  envp[0]       <-- environment variables, required by main()/getenv()
        *        envp[1]
        *        ...
        *        NULL
        *
        * NOT IMPLEMENTED:
        * _auxv: _auxv[0]      <-- auxiliary vector, required by getauxval()
        *        _auxv[1]
        *        ...
        *        NULL
        */

        argc = *sp;
        argv = (void *)(sp + 1);
        envp = argv + argc + 1;

        ret = _mylib_main(argc, argv, envp);

        exit(ret);
    }

    /*
    * Start up code inspired by the Linux kernel's nolibc header library.
    * x86-64 System V ABI requires:
    * - %rsp must be 16-byte aligned before calling a function
    * - Deepest stack frame should be zero (%rbp)
    *
    * Requires -fomit-frame-pointer to work.
    */
    void __attribute__((noreturn, optimize("omit-frame-pointer"))) _start() {
        __asm__ volatile (
                "xor  %ebp, %ebp\n"  // zero the stack frame
                "mov  %rsp, %rdi\n"  // save stack pointer to %rdi, as arg1 of _start_c
                "and  $-16, %rsp\n"  // %rsp must be 16-byte aligned before call
                "call _start_c\n"    // transfer to c runtime
                "hlt\n"              // ensure it does not return
                );
        __builtin_unreachable();
    }

    #endif // __MY_LIBC_H__
    ```


Object file relocation
```shell
readelf -a echo.o
# elf headers
# section headers
#...
# symbol table
```
Symbol table:
- Global (from `my_libc.h`)
	- `_start_c`, `_start`
- Global (from main)
	- `main`, `my_strlen`
- Compiler adds local symbols (static)
	- `syscall`, `exit`, `write`
	- `echo.c` (filename), `UND` (first element is `NULL`)
When linking, don't care about **local** symbols

```shell
objdump -a echo.o
```
`main()` calls `mystrlen()`, but its (relative from the **next** instruction address) (little-Endian) address is not yet filled in 
- Linker knows the presence of a function call (`e8`), how does it know **which** function to call?
- It needs to mark it somewhere. Makes another **relocation** section `.rela.text`, containing array of the following structure.
```c
typedef struct {
	Elf64_Addr r_offset;
	uint64_t   r_info;
	int64_t    r_addend;
} Elf64_Rela;
```
- `r_offset`: the address of the unresolved function (1 after `e8`)
- `r_info`: packed with symbol and type, by macros
	- Symbol `ELF[32|64]_R_SYM`: what symbol this entry is for (nth symbol in `.symtab`). 
		- `readelf` goes to `.symtab` and figures out "Sym. Value"
	- Type `ELF[32|64]_R_TYPE`: *type* of address that you can put in
		- Absolute vs relative
		- Type 4 is `R_X86_64_PLT32`: max 64 bytes relative

### Multiple objects
really really difficult
Somehow, multiple object files brings whole new complexity

#### `echo2`
Separate two global functions `my_libc.h`.
- `_start_c()` and `_start()` (two global functions) are separated to `my_libc.c`
- You can start debugging with 2 object files, and extend it to the general case

#### `sum`
General case: `sum`, with 5 C files
- `main.c`: main function declaring an array of 5 longs, declaring and calling `sum_array()` and `my_strlen()`, `print_ulong()`
- `sum.c`: Defines `sum_array()` and `sum()`
- `print_ulong.c`: `print_ulong()` 

```shell
./cld *.o
./a.out

readelf -a main.o
```
The address of `sum_array`, `my_strlen`, `print_ulong` are undefined, but there are **relocation entries** (`.rela.text`)
- `my_strlen` appears twice, since it's called twice
- **Offset**: where in the object file these calls happen
- **Info**: symbol index
Only when you combine all object files into a single text section and rewrite all the symtab entries, you can do relocation
When parsing `main.o`:
- **Ignore** local functions. They don't go to the executable.
- For global:
	- `main` in section 1
	- `sum_array` UND
	- `my_strlen` UND
	- `print_ulong` UND
**Symbol resolution**: create a **union** of all symtabs `output_symtab`. Determine which section they belong
- Need mapping from input symtab to output symtab
- When you see the second object file that defines or calls `my_strlen`, you need to know that it's collected already
- If a symbol is never defined, linker error
- If multiple definitions, linker error

For the executable, need to:
- Fix all `st_value`. 
- Recalculate `st_name` (index into `.strtab`). Need to generate a new strtab that's a union of all previous strtabs
- Fix `.rela.text` entries with new offset and info index from the new `.symtab`

## Static library
Library: collection of **object** files, packaged into a single archive file that can be linked against
E. Make `vector` library
```sh
ar rcs libvector.a addvec.o multivec.o
gcc main.o libvector.a -o main
gcc main.o -lvector -o main     # equivalent
```
- Linking `libvector.a` doesn't mean you link **all** the files. It only picks as needed.
- Linker processes objects from **left to right**, so archives go **last**
	- Archives only resolve previously unmatched symbols
	- If circular reference, need to list libraries multiple times
	
**Static**: once you pull the objects, it becomes **part** of your executable `main`

## Shared library
Static is wasteful. Every executable will have a copy of the object referenced.
**Shared**: generate *incomplete* executable. When it's run, link the objects shared on the disk by `mmap()`
- Multiple processes can also `mmap()` to a shared library
```sh
$ make
gcc -Wall -fpic   -c -o main.o main.c
gcc -Wall -fpic   -c -o sum.o sum.c
gcc -shared -o libsum.so sum.o
gcc -o main-dyn main.o libsum.so
```
- Need `-fpic` to generate objects that will eventually go in a **shared lib**
	- (Forces every address have to be relative, position independent)
- `-shared` flag creates a *shared* library `libsum.so` from `sum.o`
- `main-dyn` does not contain `sum.o`. It only contains the **shell** that helps *accessing* `sum.o`

### Loading shared library
Now run `./main-dyn`. Doesn't work!
```shell
$ # Dynamic linker can't find our libsum shared library
$ ./main-dyn 
./main-dyn: error while loading shared libraries: libsum.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
Need to use  `ldd` to find the libraries needed to be loaded at runtime
```shell
$ ldd main-dyn
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc951cf000)
        libsum.so => not found     # main-dyn *knows* about the shared lib
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f279d400000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f279d74f000)
```
- It knows it needs `libsum.so`, but can't find it
- Also knows and finds `libc.so.6`
Shared libraries can be found in 3 ways:
1. In predefined system directory: /lib, /lib64, ...
2. Routinely run `ldconfig` that maintains a configuration file `/etc/ld.so.conf`
3. (simple) Declare environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
```shell
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
```
- This is **temporary**
- To make it permanent, run `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.`

### Load library with `dlopen()`
Do it at **runtime**: dynamically link against `libsum.so`, find `sum_array()`, and calls it
`main-dlopen.c`
```c
#include <dlfcn.h>

int main() {
	// lazily load dynamic library
    void *handle = dlopen("libsum.so", RTLD_LAZY);

    long (*f)(long *p, int n) = dlsym(handle, "sum_array");

    long a[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    long sum = f(a, 5);
    printf("sum=%ld\n", sum);

    dlclose(handle);
}
```

No linking at link time:
```sh
gcc -Wall main-dlopen.c
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. 
./a.out
```

### Library interpositioning
`mymalloc.c`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

/* malloc wrapper function */
void *malloc(size_t size) {
    void *(*mallocp)(size_t size);
	// look at *other* libraries, find its malloc
    mallocp = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "malloc");
    char *ptr = mallocp(size); 
    // printf doesn't work since printf calls malloc
    fputs("malloc wrapper called\n", stderr);
    return ptr;
}
```

```sh
gcc -fpic -shared -o mm.so mymalloc.c && LD_PRELOAD=./mm.so  cal
```
- If library listed in `LD_PRELOAD`, it will also be loaded **first**
	- This will **intercept** standard library functions
- Result: `cal` calls `malloc()` and `free()` a lot

## Position Independent Code
PIC
- Relocation: calculate PC-relative addresses to symbols once they are **resolved** at link time
What if linking dynamically? Need fix at **runtime**.
- Don't know symbol location until library is loaded, but at runtime, **text** segment already `mmap()`ed to the address space in read only mode. Can't relocate
- Text section needs to be **writable**, which can't be shared among **processes**
- 32-bit PC relative address can't reach 64-bit shared library locations. Need 64-bit *absolute* addressing

### Data
Simpler
Create a section in *Data Segment*: **global offset table** (GOT): array of pointers you have referenced
- When calling, direct from *code* to GOT table's location in *data*
- At runtime, when libraries are loaded, GOT is filled in
- Assumes the relative location of GOT and code section is a **constant**

![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/got.png)

```assembly
mov 0x2008b9(%rip), %rax    # refer to the GOT
addl $0x1, (%rax)           # deref rax again for addcnt
```

### Function
2 levels of redirection: GOT and PLT (procedure link table)

![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/plt.png)

Before first call, `GOT[4]` has a **fake** address, since don't **want** to resolve every symbol4

**First call**
1. Jump to the PLT section of "call `addvec()`"
2. Grab `GOT[4]`, unfilled to begin with. (proceed to next instruction)
	- Push `1` onto the stack (relocation entry number for `addvec()`)
3. Jump to `PLT[0]`, a special entry in PLT that will jump to the **dynamic linker section**
	- Push address of relocation entries `GOT[1]` (also preparing arguments for the dynamic linker)
4. Jump to dynamic linker `GOT[2]`
	- Dynamic linker finds `addvec()`, do relocation, and put into `GOT[4]`
**Subsequent calls**
5. Call `addvec()`.  Jump to PLT section (array of code *snippets*)
6. Grab actual `(*)addvec()` from GOT

### Demo
- `objdump -d main-dyn`
    - `main()` executes `call 1070 <sum_array@plt>`
    - PLT entry at `1070`: `bnd jmp *0x2f45(%rip) # 3fc0 <sum_array@Base>`
- `readelf -a main-dyn`:
    - Relocation entry in `.rela.plt` for **GOT entry** (3fc0):  
```
Offset          Info           Type           Sym. Value    Sym. Name + Addend
000000003fc0  000300000007 R_X86_64_JUMP_SLO 0000000000000000 sum_array + 0
```

- `readelf -x .got main-dyn`
    - The hexdump shows the fallthrough address at `0x3fc0`: `0x1030`

    ```
    Hex dump of section '.got':

    0x00003fb8 00000000 00000000 30100000 00000000 ........0.......
    ```

- `objdump -d main-dyn`:
    - See fallthrough address in `.plt` section:

    ```
    0000000000001020 <.plt>:
    1020:       ff 35 8a 2f 00 00       push   0x2f8a(%rip)        # 3fb0 <_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+0x8>
    1026:       f2 ff 25 8b 2f 00 00    bnd jmp *0x2f8b(%rip)        # 3fb8 <_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+0x10>
    102d:       0f 1f 00                nopl   (%rax)
    1030:       f3 0f 1e fa             endbr64 
    1034:       68 00 00 00 00          push   $0x0
    1039:       f2 e9 e1 ff ff ff       bnd jmp 1020 <_init+0x20>
    103f:       90        
    ```

### Debugger
Change the code to call `sum_array()` twice
- Need to make another executable, with `-no-pie` (regular executable)
	- Shared library can come from anywhere
	- Code at a fixed address
```shell
make main-no-pie
./main-no-pie
ldb ./main-no-pie
(ldb) b 401060           # where plt section for sum_array begins
# observe GOT entry
(ldb) x 404018           # 401030, directly jump down
(ldb) c
# keep stepping
# first time: reference GOT
# eventually reach the dynamic linker address
(ldb) c
(ldb) x 404018           # (*)sum_array now!
# will call sum_array()
```

## Makefile
Position independence and dynamic linking are orthogonal concepts
- `main-dyn`: Pie (position independent) and **dynamically** normally linked
	- Linked with the C library and libsum
	- `file main-dyn` shows its's a `LSB pie executable`, `dynamically linked, interpreter ...` (loader)
	- `objdump -d main-dyn`: all addresses start from 0 (actually 1000, skipping a page for header). Not real addresses. When running, starting address can be any place in the memory
- `main-no-pie`
	- `gcc -no-pie`
	- Also dynamically linked
	- `file main-no-pie`: `LSB executable`, doesn't say "pie"
	- `objdump -d main-no-pie`: Addresses fixed, needed by `ldb`
- `main-static-pie`: statically linked with `pie`
	- `gcc -static-pie`
	- `ldd main-static-pie`: "statically linked", has all code in itself, very large in size
	- `file main-static-pie`: "LSB pie executable", "static-pie linked"
	- `objdump -d main-static-pie`: very long file, started from 0
- `main-static`: statically linked without `pie`
	- `gcc -static` (what `ldb` and `cld` uses)
	- `ldd main-static`: "not a dynamic executable"
	- `file main-static`: "statically linked", no "pie"
	- `objdump -d`: address starting randomly
