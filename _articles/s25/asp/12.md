## Debugger breakpoint
How is it implemented?
Tracer `fork()`s, and the child program becomes the tracee, but before that, makes a syscall `ptrace()`, so the parent process can control this.

Instruction `int3`, OS stops the program, and sends info to the **tracer** of the program

## Processor modes
- **User mode** (mode bit = 1): can't do privileged operations
- **Kernel mode** (mode bit = 0): can performed privileged operations and has full **hardware** access
Allows user program to "trap" into kernel and "return from trap"

## Interrupt
Stop the CPU from executing the current instructions and makes it jump to a predetermined piece of **OS kernel code**
- If a user process does `while(1)`, OS must have ways to **interrupt** this,
- Time interrupt handler sees if a process is running too long. If so, it will put it to sleep and run others.

1. **Hardware interrupt**
	- Asynchronous (can arrive at any time)
	- Timer interrupt
	- Network packet arrival, key press, ...
2. **Exceptions & Faults**
	- Synchronous: result of **executing** some instruction
	- E. division by 0, segmentation fault, page fault
3. Software interrupt
	- Synchronous, **deliberately** **raised** by software (`int <code>`) in x86 
	- System call
	- Debugger breakpoints (`int3`, single byte)

### CPU cycle
```
while (1) {
	if (HWint or exception) {
		n = int/exception type    // exception flag
		call interrupt handler n
	}

	fetch next instrction
	if (instruction == int n)
		call interrupt handler n
	else
		run instruction
}
```

Interrupts are not userspace **signals**
- **Signals**: enables communication between **processes** and OS
- **Interrupts**: enables communication between **hardware** and OS
    - but some interrupts can generate userspace signals…
        - divide by zero exception: `SIGFPE`
        - illegal memory access: `SIGSEGV`
        - software breakpoint: `SIGTRAP`

## Linux System Call
User program invokes `read()`:
1. libc system call wrapper invokes software interrupt `0x80` (system call)
    - Places syscall number `__NR_read` into `%eax` register
	```assembly
	movl __NR_read, %eax
	int 0x80                # syscall, enter kernel mode
	ret
	```
	- (also puts other parameters in the register)

2. **Trap** into kernel mode, look up `0x80` in **Interrupt Descriptor Table** (IDT)
3. Jump to interrupt `0x80`’s handler: `system_call()`
4. `system_call()` looks up `__NR_read` in `sys_call_table`
5. Unpack registers, call `__NR_read`’s handler: `sys_read()`
6. Perform `read()`’s real work in kernel’s `sys_read()`
    - file entry management, I/O requests, copying data, etc.

## Breakpoints
Stop execution at arbitrary points, E. using `int3`
- Debugger replace the **byte** at `addr` with `int3` and restore the byte later
- When `int3` reached, trigger interrupt, OS takes over, notify debugger (`SIGTRAP`)
- Debugger intercepts `SIGTRAP` and regains control
Only works for breakpoints at an instruction
- E. can't stop if a variable has changed
- CPU offers **hardware breakpoints** (watchpoints)

## `ldb` demo
We set linux to store address at 400000, but instruction pointer is set to be a huge address: hasn't entered `main()` yet. 
- Starts with some library routine that's going to call `main()`

### Workflow
`ldb.c`
- `personality(ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)`: `objdump` content will be exactly the actual memory

Tracee will **stop** each time **any** signal is delivered, even if signals are ignored
- The tracer will be notified at the next call to `waitpid()`
- `waitpid()` will return a **status** value, telling why child is stopped (any signals received)
	- Whenever kernel wants to stop the child (E. at the beginning of `execve()`, kernel tells the debugger `SIGTRAP`)
	- Child didn't receive `SIGTRAP`, just telling the debugger that it has the control
- Debugger can inspect or modify the tracee
- Tracer can proceed, delivering the signal or not
`sumpause`
- Call `c`, `waitpid()` until it's completed
- When `SIGINT` sent to debugger, `ldb_read_signal()` reads signals and stops the child
- Now can do things to the chil
- If `c` again, the signal will be delivered to the child

### Breakpoint
```
b <insr>
x <instr>    # modified to cc
c            # break at <instr>
s            # put back the instruction, but then put `cc` back
```

```shell
objdump ./sum

ldb ./sum
(ldb) b 40114e     # break at the next 40114f
(ldb) c            # continue
(ldb@40114f*) t
# Gives a backtrace
# 0x40114f in sum:401136 (starting address of the func)
#  called from 0x... in sum_array:...
#  called from 0x... in main:...
```
Unroll the stack and backtraces, stop until hit `main`
- The **return address** of the stack is printed
- That's why the address printed is *not* the call address
It also figures out **what function makes the call**: `sum:401136`
- Need to read the **executable file** (as `objdump`), `mmap()` it
- How: ELF
