## VM and container
**VM**: Guest OS kernel run on top of a **host OS** (with the help of specialized software) controlling the actual hardware
- Give the illusion of physical machine to the guest OS
- Processes still touch the hardware, translation may be needed.
- VMs do not know the existence of each other
- **Pro**: Hard separation, **very secure**
- **Con**: each VM runs an **entire** OS kernel: resource intensive
**Container**: A group of processes that has its own view of the **underlying hardware and OS**
- One OS
- Not complete isolation
- Need to make sure processes in different containers **can't** communicate

## Linux container
Linux kernel has **no notion of containers**, only **processes**. Abstraction on **user** side
- Userspace (E. Docker or Podman) hide the complexity involved with managing containers. However, once the container is set up, it is just a group of processes to the Linux kernel.

### `cgroup`
**Resource** control group
- Organize processes into hierarchal groups, whose resource usage can be monitored and limited
- Remain until system rebooted
- Managed thorough `cgroupfs`, a fake file system mounted as `/sys/fs/cgroup`

```sh
# Go to the mounting location of the cgroup fs (file system)
cd /sys/fs/cgroup/

# List the controllers (knobs) that are available
cat cgroup.controllers
cpuset cpu io memory hugetlb pids rdma misc

# List the controllers that are active.
cat cgroup.subtree_control 
cpuset cpu io memory pids

# Create a child cgroup
sudo su
mkdir asp
cd asp
```
Create child directory, specify that processes added to the `asp` directory's CPU limit is 20%.
- You can subdivide `asp`, and assign a limit to each (subdivided from the 20% limit)

```sh
# # By default, CPU usage is unbounded. Let's limit it to 20%.
cat cpu.max
max 100000
echo "20000 100000" > cpu.max    # numerator / denominator
```

Test a `stress` process and add it to `cgroup` `asp`
```sh
# test CPU usage with stress, spines *one* CPU with sqrt
stress -c 1 &       # moved to background, PID = 1000

cat croup.procs     
                    # none now
echo 1000 > cgroup.procs
# now stress process limited to 20% CPU

# spawn another stress
streess -c 1 &      # not limited rn, PID = 2000
echo 2000 > cgroup.procs
# now each running at 10%
```

**Max number of children**
```sh
cat pids.max
max          # no limit for now

echo 6 > pids.max  # set limit to 6
```
Bash's `fork()` will fail if you are running more than 6 processes

### Namespace
Resource isolation: containers
- Wraps a global resource in a private (virtual) view 
- E. file system, process list, network resource
System call `unshare` to create a new namespace (disassociate from previous shared ones)
```sh
unshare --fork --user --pid --map-root-user --mount-proc /bin/bash
```
- `--fork`: fork off `/bin/bash`
- `--user`: create a new user namespace
- `--pid`: Create new PID namespae
- `--map-root-user`: map the current user to **root**
- `-mount-proc`: create a new mount namespace and mount `procfs` in it. The bash PID will be 1.

Now your username changes to `root@spoc`. Can't see outside processes
```sh
ps uf
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root           1  0.0  0.0   9200  5120 pts/68   S    15:36   0:00 /bin/bash
root           8  0.0  0.0  10464  3200 pts/68   R+   15:36   0:00 ps uf
```
Outside the namespace:
```sh
ps uf
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
mg4264   1897751  0.4  0.0   9284  5248 pts/81   Ss   15:37   0:00 -bash
mg4264   1897763  0.0  0.0  10464  3200 pts/81   R+   15:37   0:00  \_ ps uf
mg4264   1895523  0.0  0.0   9284  5120 pts/68   Ss   15:07   0:00 -bash
mg4264   1897702  0.0  0.0   6192  1792 pts/68   S    15:36   0:00  \_ unshare --fork --user --pid --map-root-user --mount-proc /bin/bash
mg4264   1897703  0.0  0.0   9200  5120 pts/68   S+   15:36   0:00      \_ /bin/bash
```
normal user and different PID

### Capabilities
Further limit what processes created by `root` can do, in general
- Privileged process: bypass all kernel permission check
- Unprivileged process
Divide the root permissions into categories: **capabilities** (E. change owner, kill other users' procs)
E. `sshd` divides sensitive info to child processes, and drop capabilities
- In case something is hijacked, minimize damage
#-## `seccomp()`
System call that operates on the Secure Computing (`seccomp`) state of the calling process
- A lot of the syscalls are developed without namespaces. Not updated. Calling them may create vulnerabilities
- Limit the system calls you can call if you don't need to 
- E. if set `SECCOMP_SET_MODE_STRICT`: process can only call `read()`, `write()`, not even `open()`
	- If the program hacked, hacker can't do much

## Lab 6 Zookeeper
Linux container

### Part 1
Create a process using `clone()`
```sh
./sol-part1 /bin/bash
# execute clone to create /bin/bash
# will see /bin/bash created
```
1. Allocate child stack with `mmap()`
2. Create a child process with `clone()`
3. Signal child to run through the pipe. Then close the pipe
4. `waitpid()` for child to terminate
	- If there's a signal, forward to parent

### Part 2
Create namespaces
- `clone()` has a bunch of flags to create isolated namespaces
```sh
./sol-part2 /bin/bash
# changed to root user root@zoo
```

#### 2.2 
A bit of programming installing `subuid` and `subgid` maps
```sh
cat /etc/subuid
# gives a UID range allocated
```
For each user, allocate 65536 user IDs, starting from a number
In `root@zoo` namespace, I can create a user, but it needs to be **mapped** to a real user
1. `getuid()` and `getgid()` to get current user and group ID
2. `newuidmap` and `newgidmap` to install the mappings (writes to `/proc/<container-pid>/uid_map`)

### Part 3
Drop dangerous capabilities using `capabilities`
```sh
./sol-part3 /bin/bash
cd   # have view of the entire file system
```

### Part 4
Virtualize file system
In `/opt/asp`, there is a `tar` file
```sh
cd /opt/asp
tar tf zoo-fs.tar
# shows entire file content (Linux distribution)

cd
mkdir zoo-fs
cd zoo-fs
(umask 0 tar xf /opt/asp/zoo-fs.tar)
# temporarily clear umask so that files/directories retain their intended permissions
# () runs in a subshell, so it doesn't affect my current umask
    # extract it

sol-part4 -r ./zoo-fs
# -r: mount ./zoo-fs as root
```
Call `mount()` to set up mount namespace

Now you would have an isolated bash shell. You can run `ls`, but we have not installed `cowchat`

### Part 5
`cgroup`
```sh
part5 -c 20 -r ./zoo-fs -P /bin/bash
# limits CPU usage to 20%
```
Stress is not yet installed. Go outside and `stress` it
```sh
which stress
cp /usr/bin/stress .
# now you have stress in the namespace
```

```sh
stress -c 1
```
Outside run `htop`: see stress is running, and CPU is restricted
- Our limit is 50% per user

Hard to make `cgroup`s for a non-root user. Ask `systemd` (init process) to provision a node in the `cgroup` directory hierarchy, so you can put stuff under it

### Part 6
Add networking to container
Container does not have access to network devices. If you start as a user container. Podman uses `slirp` that implements the entire TCP stack as a user program (instead of in the kernel)
```sh
ping mit.edu
apt install cowsay
apt install stress # (properly)
```
