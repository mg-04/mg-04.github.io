```shell
ps axf     # display process tree
ps axfj    # with more info
ps axfjww  # even if lines wrap around terminal
```

## Processes
- **Orphan**: parents terminate before children
	- `init` adopts it and periodically calls `waitpid()` 
- **Zombie**: child terminated, but *parent* never calls `waitpid()`
	- It will show in the process tree as `<defunct>`

### Memory mappings
When a process `fork()`s, its mappings are duplicated for the child

**Copy-On-Write:**
- Even pieces in stack/text/code are shared and marked as *read only*
- Once when memory is written, OS splits it to two
- Delays duplication of memory space.
- Efficient since `fork()` is typically followed by `exec()`, which will trash the memory anyway
- `exec()` loads a new program code into memory by mapping its executable file to the text region of the address space

## Process groups job control
```shell
proc1 | proc2
```
`proc1` and `proc2` share the same **group ID** (`PGID`)
```shell
proc1 | proc2 &    # & sends pipeline to background
# [1] 7106         # [<job number>] <leading PID>
proc3 | proc4 | proc5
```
All share the same **session ID** (`SID`)

If you send a signal, it's delivered to the *foreground* process group
- `jobs`: List all jobs
- `Ctrl-Z`: Suspend (`SIGSTOP`) foreground job and send to the background
- `bg <job>`: Resume `<job>` in the background
- `fg <job>`: Bring backgrouded `<job>` into the foreground
