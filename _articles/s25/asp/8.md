## Pipes
### Unnamed pipe
No file name, just an fd
```c
#include <unistd.h>
int pipe(int fd[2]);
```
Kernel prepares a pipe structure, connecting `fd[0]` (read) with `fd[1]` (write)
After `fork()`, parent and child will share the same *pipe*. 
- Pipe is one-way traffic (**half duplex**)
- Need to `close()` unused ends of pipe

```c
int fd[2];
pipe(fd);

if (fork() == 0) {
    close(fd[1]);  // close unused write end
    read(fd[0], ...);
} else {
    close(fd[0]);  // close unused read end
    write(fd[1], ...)
}
```

### `connect2`
How a shell would stitch together two processes for a pipeline
(E. `p1 | p2` becomes `./connect2 p1 -- p2`)

```c
int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
```
If `newfd` is open, `dup2()` will *close* it first, and duplicate `oldfd` to `newfd`
- Atomic operation

1. Creates two child processes
2. Stitch the IO together

```c
pipe(fd);

if ((pid1 = fork()) == 0) {
	close(fd[0]);   // Close read end of pipe
	dup2(fd[1], 1); // Redirect stdout to write end of pipe
	close(fd[1]);   // stdout already writes to pipe, close spare fd
	execvp(*argv1, argv1);   // fds preserved
}

if ((pid2 = fork()) == 0) {
	close(fd[1]);   // Close write end of pipe
	dup2(fd[0], 0); // Redirect stdin from read end of pipe
	close(fd[0]);   // stdin already reads from pipe, close spare fd
	execvp(*argv2, argv2);
}

// Parent does not need either end of the pipe
close(fd[0]);
close(fd[1]); 
```

### Named pipes
If something's unnamed, you can only use it between related processes
```c
#include <sys/stat.h>
int mkfifo(const char *path, mode_t mode);
```
**Blocked** in `open()` until someone else opens the other end
- Fine for multiple processes to R/W
- But at least one reader and one writer.
- Analogous to unnamed pipe (`read()` will block for empty unnamed pipe, same for write)

## Memory mapped IO
Memory Mapping `mmap()
- Shared, file-backed: can link **unrelated** processes
	- Avoid physical file with `shm_open()` (shared mem open)
	- Will create a "fake file" under `/dev/shm` (an in-memory filesystem)
- Shared, anonymous: Must be **related**, no actual file involved
- Private, file-backed: private copy of the file in memory, not written back to file
- Private, anonymous: Just allocate memory (E. malloctopus)

## POSIX Semaphore
Also available in unnamed and Named
- For multiple *processes* (instead of thread), semaphore object needs to reside in a **file** for every process to see it

Create a multi-process semaphore embedded in some other structure (`counter`), and then putting it into a **shared anonymous** memory region

```c
struct counter {   // semaphore
    sem_t sem;
    int cnt;
};
static struct counter *counter = NULL;

// multiple processes will run this loop
static void inc_loop() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        sem_wait(&counter->sem);
        counter->cnt++;
        sem_post(&counter->sem);
    }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // Create a shared anonymous memory mapping, set global pointer to it
    counter = mmap(/*addr=*/NULL, /*let mmap decide*/
				   sizeof(struct counter),
                   // Region is readable and writable
                   PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                   // Want to share anonymous mapping with forked child
                   MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS,
                   /*fd=*/-1,  // No associated file (anony)
                   /*offset=*/0);
    assert(counter != MAP_FAILED);
    assert(counter->cnt == 0);  // Mapping is already zero-initialized.

    sem_init(&counter->sem, /*pshared=*/1, /*value=(binary)*/1);

    pid_t pid;
    if ((pid = fork()) == 0) {
        inc_loop();
        return 0;
    }

    inc_loop();
    waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);

    printf("Total count: %d, Expected: %d\n", counter->cnt, 1000 * 2);

    sem_destroy(&counter->sem);
    munmap(counter, sizeof(struct counter));  // aka free
}
```
Unnamed semaphore are just `sem_t` objects passed to `sem_init()` and `sem_destroy()`

How about **named** semaphore? Passed to `sem_open()`, and it gives back a pointer to a newly *created* named `sem_t` object *file*.
- Necessary for unrelated processes
