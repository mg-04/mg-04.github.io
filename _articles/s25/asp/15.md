Single **root** directory, not necessarily a single *device*
Need to designate a disk to be the **root** file system
For external devices' file system, need to **mount** it to some place at that file system 
- `mount -l` shows all mount points
```
/dev/sda1 on / type ext4
students251 on /mnt/disks/aspstudents251 type zfs
```
- `dev`: a region for devices
- `sda1`: hard disk device
- `type ext4`: Metadata structure to use this device 

## Mounting types
### `/proc`
An entire fake file system maintained by the kernel, where entries are **PIDs**, with all info about it
- This directory is *mounted* to a file system that is not on the disk, but on the memory
- When kernel reads, it will not go to the disk
- With root permissions, you can **write** to these `/proc` files

- `/proc/self` tells about the current process
- `/proc/self/maps` shows all `mmap`s
```
proc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
```

### Bind mount
Bind-mounts allow you to mount a directory within an *existing* filesystem onto somewhere else in the hierarchy, effectively creating a new entry point.
- `sudo mount --bind <existing-dir> <mount-point>`
- Similar to a sym link
- Appears in the mount table

## Berkley File System (FFS)
**inode** structure

![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/ffs.png)

- **Super block**: FS metadata (file system size, inode count, offset, ...)
- **Cylinder**: further partition
	- Metadata
	- **i-node map**: which i-node is free/used
	- **Block map**: which block is free/used
	- **i-nodes**: array of i-nodes. Each stores a file *or directory*'s
		- Metadata
		- **Pointers** to data blocks
	- **Data blocks**

### Directory
A directory is a *special file* with
- i-node number
- Filename
Two directories may point to the **same** i-node. There can be multiple names for a single file. i-node number is the only unique identifier. Filename is just what the directory refers to the i-node by

![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/inode.png)

Directory of "2549" is referred by "testdir" in 1267, and "." in 2549 (itself)

### Hard link
```sh
echo howdy > f1
ln f1 f2            # hard link a new f2 to f1
```
Once hard links are created, can't distinguish. They refer to the **same i-node** number in `ll`
- `f2` is not a copy or a shortcut
- `ll` also shows the link count: how many *filenames* are linked with the i-node
Hard links are **not allowed** for directories
- Too dangerous, unless you're the system that creates `.` and `..`

### Symlink
```sh
ln -s f1 s1         # sym link s1 to f1
```
A separate file (i-node) that is marked with a special type
- Content: just characters `f1`
- `greptile` can ignore symlink via `lstat`, but can't ignore hard link
- If a the file is removed, it will be a **broken** symlink

Symlink can point to a path, but you can't create a hard link that's from another file system, since i-node doesn't have any meaning in a different file system
