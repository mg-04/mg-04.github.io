Executable and Linking Format (for Linux)
1. `readelf` reads executable and finds all information
2. Go through all the *symbols*, see if the calling return address falls between

For both object files, and the resulting executable files

## Structure
executable format

- **ELF header**: first 64 bytes of executable or .o file
	- `typedef struct {...}`
	- Magic, class, data, version, machine, size, ...
	- `e_ident`: first 4 bytes to identify an ELF file
- **Segment header table**: (aka array of segment headers)
	- Multiple sections that will be **loaded** into memory are grouped into **segments**
	- Runner will look this and load the sections

- `.rodata`: read only data (E. "string"s)
- `.data`: **initialized** global variable
- `.bss`: **zero**, or **uninitialized** global variable
- `.symtab`, `.debug`:for linking, not loaded into memory
- **Section header table**: sections, not segments
	- Linker will look at this to stitch

- Section for linking
	- Some sections **not** used for execution, E. string section
- Segment for **executing**
