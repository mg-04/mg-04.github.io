# Memory
## Address Space
![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/addr-space.png)

32 bit: each program uses 3G bottom. The top 1G designated for OS kernel code and data

**Program break** (`brk`, end of program): top of the heap (increasing allocates memory; decreasing deallocates), updated via `brk()`
- When `malloc()` called, it tries to allocated a piece from heap
- Library asks OS to set aside heap area
- `brk()` system call changes program break
- `malloc()` and `free()` then manages the new heap area

- Each process *thinks* they own the entire process space
- Independent processes
**Mapping** 
- By chunk (page) 4096 B
- Certain VM may be mapped to the *same* physical memory (**shared memory**)

### `malloc()` and `free()`
For 32-bit, block (word) is 4 **bytes**. All blocks align at 8-byte (**double-word**) boundary to ensure efficient memory access
For 64-bit (ours), all blocks align to **16**-byte boundaries
- **Internal fragmentation**: padding, when allocation > request
- **External fragmentation**: memory is in pieces, can't allocate large blocks  

## Implicit Free List
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the **payload**, NOT the beginning of the allocated **block**

- 4-byte (1 word) header to store **block size** (including header)
	- block size multiple of 8 (for 32b), so last 3 bits unused
	- Make last bit to mark allocation
- Payload
- Padding (optional)  
- Footer (same as header)

![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/implicit-heap.png)

- First block unused
- Middle blocks
	- 4-byte header
	- Payload (double-word aligned)
	- Padding (optional)
	- Footer
- Last block unused (**epilogue**, allocated block size=0 suggests end)

```c
char *heap_start = NULL;

// called before main()
void __init_heap() {
	heap_start = sbrk(4096);
	heap_start += 4;      // skip prologue padding
}

void *malloc(size_t size) {
	char *block = heap_start;
	while (1) {
		uint32_t header = *(uint32_t *)block;
		size_t block_size = header & ~0x7;
		int allocated = header & 0x1;

		if (block_size == 0)  return NULL;    // epilogue reached, failed
		if (!allocated && size <= block_size) {  // first fit search
			*(uint32_t *)block = block_size | 0x1;  // take the whole block
			return block + 4;	                 // pointer to payload	
		}
		block += block_size;
	}
}
```

### Finding Fit
- First fit
- Next fit
- Best fit

### Coalescing
**False fragmentation**: free blocks chopped into small, unusable
Need create a larger block with updated block size
- Need to reach previous and next neighbor
	- Add **footer** to locate previous neighbor
	- Minimum block size changes from 8 to **16** bytes
	- The first block (header, footer, after first unused 4 bytes) becomes the **prologue block**
- Real allocators delay coalescing to save computation

## Explicit Free List
- Implicit links **all** blocks. Inefficient
- Explicit uses unused free blocks to link **free** blocks (2 pointers)
Doubly linked list (`NULL` if end reached)

![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/explicit.png)

![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/explicit-heap.png)

**LIFO** order: put newly freed blocks at the beginning of the linked list
- Exploits *temporal locality*


In HW, **circular** doubly linked list with a **sentinel node**
- When free list empty, sentinel node points to itself
- When not empty, sentinel's `fnext` points to the first node. `fprev` points to the last node
Need to modify the prologue block to contain a 16-byte payload as the sentinel
When *coalescing*, all pointers totally messed up!
- Next: Take existing one from the list, coalesce it, and put it back
- Prev: easy case
???

### Segregated Free Lists
Maintain **multiple** free lists
- Each contains blocks of similar size

## Memory Mapping `mmap()`
`mmap()` system call maps a portion of the file into the address space and treat it like an array of bytes
- Alternative to `read()` and `write()`
- Not faster, but makes program simpler

Virtual address space(s) --(map)-> RAM space --(map)-> File
- If two processes map the same file, OS goes thru the same **physical memory**
- Any changes on one side will show up *immediately* on the other, via RAM, but not file
- RAM may interact with the file later (file IO is slow)
```c
#include <sys/mman.h>
void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flag, int fd, off_t offset);
```
**Returns** starting address of mapped region if OK, `MAP_FAILED` on error
- `addr`: starting address of the new mapping
	- `NULL` will let `mmap()` decide the starting address
- `length`, `offset` for the file
- `prot`: protection of the mapped region (e.g., read, write, execute)
- `flag`: options
	- `MAP_SHARED`: Updates to the mapping are visible to other processes, and are carried through to the underlying file
    - `MAP_PRIVATE`: Updates *not* visible to other processes (separate RAM), and not getting into the actual file (useful for debugging)
    - `MAP_ANONYMOUS`: **Shared** anonymous mapping. This has the effect of simply allocating memory to the process when used with `MAP_PRIVATE` ^f7a1df
	    - One process does `MAP_ANONYMOUS` and `fork()`, so everything gets duplicated. Two processes share the same anonymous mapping
	    - What's the point of private anonymous mapping? Claim space from OS
- `fd`: File **descriptor** for the file (from `open()`). Use -1 for **anonymous mapping** (just two processes sharing IO)

## HW 1
### Padding
- Separate variables (E. `char`)can start at any byte boundary
- Variables in `struct`s are aligned to its **widest member**
Trailing padding affects (`sizeof()`)

Nested `struct`
```C
struct foo {
	char c;               
	char pad1[7];
	struct foo_inner {
		char *p;
		short x;
		char pad2[6];
	} inner;
};
```
`char *p` forces the inner and outer `struct` to be **pointer** aligned

### Bitfield
Declare structure fields of smaller than `char` width
- Padding may be before or after
- Bitfields can't cross **word** boundary
	```c
	struct foo {
		int big1:63;      // 64-bit word 1 begins
		int big2:63;      // 64-bit word 2 begins
		int lil1:1;
		int lil2:1;       // 64-bit word 3 begins
	}
	```
Base type are interpreted for **signedness**, but not necessarily for **size**


## Memory hierarchy
![alt](/articles/s25/asp/images/mem-hir.png)
- **Registers** part of CPU
- **Cache** SRAM between registers and RAM, accessed in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">64-byte block</span> (cache lines)
- **Main memory** (D)RAM, 4KB *pages*, still volatile
- **Secondary storage** persistent

### Cache-conscious programming (E. 2D array)
<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Temporal</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spatial</span> locality

```c
int a[3][2];
```
```
+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
| a[0][0] | a[0][1] | a[1][0] | a[1][1] | a[2][0] | a[2][1] |
+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
```

Measure runtime:
```shell
time ./program
hyperfine ./program
```

**Matrix summing**
```c
for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        sum += a[i][j];
    }
}
```
- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Spatial locality</span>: access `a` one-by-one as they are in memory, which will be loaded in one cache line (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stride 1</span>)
- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Temporal locality</span>: `sum`, `a`, `i`, `j` frequently referenced. Compilers will cache them in *registers*
If order of `i`, `j` swapped, then *poor* spatial locality (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stride N</span>)

**Matrix multiplication**
```c
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        sum = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
            sum += a[i][k] * b[k][j];
        }
        c[i][j] += sum;
    }
}
```
Assume `sum` is *cached* into a register to prevent repeatedly accessing `c[i][j]`; 2 loads, 0 stores
- `a` accessed in stride-1 (`k`)
- `b` accessed in stride-n (`j`)

```c
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
        r = a[i][k];
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            c[i][j] += r * b[k][j];
        }
    }
}
```
- There are two memory loads and one memory store
- `b` and `c` are both accessed in stride-1

**Summary**
- Optimize *inner loops*, which tends to dominate computation and memory access
- Strive for *stride-1* for spatial locality
- Once data is read from memory, use it as much as possible for temporal

### Real-life allocators
**GNU libc**
- Reduce contention in *multi-threaded* environments 
    - Break heap into multiple separate “arenas” for each thread
    - Per-thread caching of recently freed blocks (likely to `malloc()` a similar-size block)
- Handle *huge requests* **off** the heap by asking the OS kernel directly using `mmap()`, which creates new page mappings for the process
- **Deferred coalescing**: maintain fast turnaround free lists
- Segregated storage: maintain small bins holding *fixed-size* chunks, instead of a range Periodically **shrink** the heap when blocks at the top of the heap are freed

**Memory Pool Allocator**
Specially used for frequent allocation and deallocation of the same *type* of object
- Allocate a large region and *divide* into equal-sized objects
- Eliminates external fragmentation
