# Exam Cheat Sheets for ELEN 3801 Signals and Systems
Please obtain my permission before sharing this with others.

Feel free to use this skeleton to customize your own cheat sheet.

## Content
This cheat sheet aims for a complete coverage of the material while also optimizing for readability and fast access.

### What's included
- Definitions, properties, proofs
- Common algebraic, trignometric, complex identities 
- Integral, convolution, FS, FT, LT table
- Frequenly used problems and corner cases
- Trivial yet conveinient formula (E. $$\sin(n\pi) = 0$$)
- Concepts and problems in the book that are not (specifically) covered in class
- Additional annotation instructions in the `.tex` file

### What's NOT included
- Trivial steps in proofs (E. most proofs by simple u-sub)
- General in-class/homework problems, as they can be quickly solved by using the correct formula.
- Guarentee of correctness/complete coverage

## Format
1. This cheat sheet is organized in sequential (not necessarily logical) order, which typically mirrors exam structure.
2. For definite integrals, $$\int$$ implies $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}$$. For sums, $$\sum$$ implies $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}$$ or $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}$$.
3. For block diagrams, arrows are assumed to point to summers. Otherwise they are from left to right. The left side is the input $$F(s)$$, and the right side is the output $$Y(s)$$.
4. To save space, $$\sin$$ and $$\cos$$ may be abbreviated as s and c, respectively.
5. Frequently used symbols and commands are abbreaviated in the `.tex` file to save my pinky finger :)
6. Unfortunately I did not boldface complex variables. You can denote them with a tilde
7. $$\equiv$$ typically denotes definition, or emphasizes that something is predefined.
8. Due the `pdflscape` settings, when printing double-sided, flip on the *opposite* edge.

## Future work if you are interested
1. TikZ the block diagrams
2. `align*` all equations while fitting everything to 4 pages
3. Graph out some sample problems

Good luck!
