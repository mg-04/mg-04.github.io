Final project for PHYS 221 Relativity and Cosmology  
[Report](/articles/SR/Relativity_Final_Project.pdf) | [Presentation](/articles/SR/relativity_final_slides.pdf)  
Rogue planets are unbound, planet‐mass bodies drifting through the Galaxy. 
- Origin: sub‐brown dwarfs from collapsing gas clouds or as planets ejected from young systems
- Detection: via microlensing and thermal imaging
- Simulation: predict their chances of capture, flyby, or exchange when encountering a star and its planet.
