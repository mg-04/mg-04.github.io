Final project for MATH 312 Analysis  
[Report](/Resources/SR/Analysis_Final_Project.pdf) | [Slides](/Resources/SR/Analysis_Final_Project_Slides.pdf)  
Exp and log functions, revisited with real analysis
- Rigorous definition of $$\ln(x)$$, and $$\exp(x)$$ as its inverse
- Proved algebraic and calculus identities of exp and log
- Extended $$x^r$$ to all real $$r$$ and derived the general power rule
